# Bruce Wayne: Boy of Steel

Thomas and Martha named their new son Bruce, after the Scottish king, Robert the
Bruce, whose bravery and nobility they hoped to instill in their son.

Young Bruce would want for nothing. He would attend the best schools in Gotham,
and have every benefit that could be afforded to him.

Bruce enjoyed a life much like other children of families in Gotham's upper
echelon of society, until one day when things changed. A few
months after his tenth birthday, he was taking a fencing lesson, and attempted
to parry an oncoming attack. As he struck the other blade, his opponent went
flying backwards.

Thomas knew this day would eventually come. Within the pod that brought Bruce to
Earth, there was a device that included a message for Thomas and Martha from
Bruce's birth parents, Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van. In this message, they explained
their reasons for sending their son, Kal-El, away from Krypton. Jor-El explained
his theories about the effect of a yellow sun on Kryptonian physiology. He
explained to Thomas and Martha that he expected that one day, Kal-El might
exhibit strange abilities.

Thomas and Martha agreed that now was the time to tell young Bruce the true
story of his birth, and how he came to join their family. They showed Bruce to a
secret passage behind the old grandfather clock in his father's study. The door
opened to a stone staircase, leading down into a series of caves beneath Wayne
Manor.

When the Waynes took in Bruce, Thomas moved his pod into those caves. He also
built a secret entrance from the library that led down to them. In these
caverns, Thomas would reverse engineer much of the technology within the
pod. During periods when Wayne Enterprises was floundering, Thomas would use the
technology he'd discovered in the Kryptonian craft to bolster the company. Wayne
Tech would become the most successful branch of the company and Thomas Wayne
would enjoy a glorious reputation as a great inventor thanks to this
extraterrestrial technology.

Bruce couldn't believe what he was seeing. A secret workshop beneath his own
home. He knew his father was an inventor; he'd been to his lab at Wayne
Tech. But it certainly didn't compare to the strange and amazing devices he was
seeing here.

And in the center, a sleek silver orb about the size of a trunk.

"Bruce," Thomas said, "it's time for us to tell you where you really came from."

"What do you mean? I'm your son. I know where I came from. I was born here at
home. I've seen my birth certificate."

"Of course you're our son, Bruce," said Martha. "We've raised you since you were
a baby. But the birth certificate is a lie. You weren't born here. You weren't
even born on this planet."
