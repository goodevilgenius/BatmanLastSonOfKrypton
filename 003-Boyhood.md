# Bruce Wayne: Boy of Steel

Thomas and Martha named their new son Bruce, after the Scottish king, Robert the
Bruce, whose bravery and nobility they hoped to instill in their son.

Young Bruce would want for nothing. He would attend the best schools in Gotham,
and have every benefit that could be afforded to him.

Under Wayne Manor, there was a series of caves. When the Waynes took in Bruce,
Thomas moved the pod into those caves. He also built a secret entrance from the
library that led down into the caves. In these caverns, Thomas would reverse
engineer much of the technology within the pod. During periods when Wayne
Enterprises was floundering, Thomas would use the technology he'd discovered in
the Kryptonian craft to bolster the company. Wayne Tech would become the most
successful branch of the company and Thomas Wayne enjoy a glorious reputation as
a great inventor thanks to this alien technology.

As Bruce grew, it became clear that he wasn't like other boys his age. A few
months after his tenth birthday, he was taking a fencing lesson, and attempted
to parry an oncoming attack. As he struck the other blade, his opponent went
flying backwards.
