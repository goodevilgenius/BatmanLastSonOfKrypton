# Bruce Wayne: Boy of Steel

Under Wayne Manor, there was a series of caves. When the Waynes took in the alien child,
Thomas moved the pod into those caves. He also built a secret entrance from the
library that led down into the caves. In these caverns, Thomas would reverse
engineer much of the technology within the pod. During periods when Wayne
Enterprises was floundering, Thomas would use the technology he'd discovered in
the Kryptonian craft to bolster the company. Wayne Tech would become the most
successful branch of the company and Thomas Wayne would enjoy a glorious reputation as
a great inventor thanks to this extraterrestrial technology.

Thomas and Martha named their new son Bruce, after the Scottish king, Robert the
Bruce, whose bravery and nobility they hoped to instill in their son.

Young Bruce would want for nothing. He would attend the best schools in Gotham,
and have every benefit that could be afforded to him.

As Bruce grew, it became clear that he wasn't like other boys his age. A few
months after his tenth birthday, he was taking a fencing lesson, and attempted
to parry an oncoming attack. As he struck the other blade, his opponent went
flying backwards.

Thomas knew this day would eventually come. Within the pod that brought Bruce to
Earth, there was a device that included a message for Thomas and Martha from
Bruce's birth parents, Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van. In this message, they explained
their reasons for sending their son, Kal-El, away from Krypton. Jor-El explained
his theories about the effect of a yellow sun on Krypton physiology. He
explained to Thomas and Martha that he expected that one day, Kal-El might
exhibit strange abilities.

Thomas and Martha agreed that now was the time to tell young Bruce the true
story of his birth, and how he came to join their family. They showed Bruce to a
secret passage behind the old grandfather clock in his father's study. The door
opened to a stone staircase, leading down into the caves beneath Wayne Manor.
