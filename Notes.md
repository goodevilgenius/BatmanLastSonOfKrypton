# Notes

## Chapter 3

I'm not sure when his powers should manifest yet. The ramifications for
different periods would be significant.

### Option 1: Before parents' deaths

This would allow him to grow up knowing of his powers and allow his parents to
guide him in their proper use. This also means that he could have prevented
their deaths, and failed to (likely because he was scared by Joe Chill). Along
with a need for vengeance, he'd carry some significant guilt with him.

This might allow some amount of Superboy stuff in childhood.

### Option 2: Shortly before parents' deaths

When Chill attacks him, Bruce would still be unsure of his powers. This would
still leave him with a sense of guilt, but would better explain his
inaction. This wouldn't allow for any Superboy activity, but might still allow
for some during teen years.

Perhaps, he could use his powers irresponsibly in this scenario as a teen. Might
also lead to a visit by the Legion of Super Heroes.

### Option 3: During the attack

Chill could try to shoot him as well, but the bullet could be deflected by his
invulnerable skin. This would be the first time his powers manifest.

This would be harder to do, as he would be dealing with manifesting powers and
parents' deaths at the same time. This would put a significant burden on Alfred.

### Option 4: After their deaths

In this case, Alfred would be the one to explain about his extraterrestrial
origins. This would be similar to option 3, but would add to his anger that his
powers hadn't manifested in time to save his parents. He might be even more
likely to use his power irresponsibly as a teenager once they manifest, during a
time when he doesn't yet have full control.
