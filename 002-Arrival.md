# Arrival

To others, it would seem that Thomas and Martha Wayne had all that they
wanted. They wore both born with a silver spoon in their mouths, and were well
respected in Gotham.

Thomas was born into the wealthy, and well-respected, Wayne family. His father,
Patrick, was the CEO of Wayne Enterprises. Thomas always wanted to help people,
and so he became a surgeon, and saved the lives of thousands of people. When his father
passed away, Thomas inherited the family business, and the family home, the
stately Wayne Manor.

Martha Wayne (n√©e Kane) was the daughter of Roderick Kane, the president of Kane
chemicals. She met Thomas in college, they fell in love, and married.

They were wealthy, had a beautiful home, and were admired by all. But with all
the love they had for each other, they wanted to share it. They tried countless
times to conceive, and yet they remained childless. No one but their closest
friends knew of the sorrow it brought them to never be able to bring a child
into the world.

Eventually it happened. Martha conceived. 

They were overjoyed. They began preparing for their new child. They
prepared a beautiful nursery, and told everyone of their excitement about their
upcoming child.

Near the end of her second trimester, Martha became concerned one afternoon. Her
normally active baby boy hadn't moved all day. She couldn't remember feeling him
move the day before either. She called up Thomas, and he assured her that there
could be any number of reasons why she hadn't felt any movement. But if
she was concerned, he'd call her doctor to check on the baby that day.

Within an hour, the doctor arrived. She ran several tests, but as the visit
progressed, Thomas and Martha could both see that the doctor was concerned.

"I'm sorry, Mrs. Wayne. I'm afraid he's stillborn. There's nothing I can do."

They felt like their entire world had been taken from them. They stayed at home
for weeks. They told no one what had happened, but the rumors spread like
wildfire.

One evening, after they had asked the household staff to leave them for the
evening, they sat together in the library. Thomas had the evening paper. He'd
read the same article five times and still didn't know what it said. Martha
was reading the latest novel by Richard Castle. She'd read the same paragraph
ten times.

It had been nearly a month since that visit from the doctor, and they still
thought of nothing else.

Suddenly, they saw a flash of light steak across the sky outside the window and
then heard a crash.

"What in the world was that?" asked Martha.

"I'll go find out," Thomas said. "You wait here. I'll be back soon."

Thomas followed the sound of the crash. It was a couple hundred yards from the
house, still on their estate.

As he neared the crash site, the light from his flashlight reflected off
something metallic. He approached the site and discovered some sort of pod. It
was egg-shaped and appeared to be a single piece with no apparent seams
anywhere.

He placed his hand on it and found it to be surprisingly cool. He had no time to
think about that, as it began to open upon his touch. There was a bright light
inside and he was momentarily blinded. He turned off his flashlight, and once
his eyes adjusted, he discovered inside the pod a small child, a newborn. He
couldn't be more than a few weeks old. He was wrapped in a red blanket which
bore a design of a shield with an "S" in it.

The baby looked up at him and smiled. He picked up the child and carried him
inside.

"What is it, Thomas?" Martha asked.

Thomas opened up the blanket and showed her the child. "I believe it's the
answer to our prayers."
