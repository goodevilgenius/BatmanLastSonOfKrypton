To others, it would seem that Thomas and Martha Wayne had all that they
wanted. They wore both born with a silver spoon in their mouths, and were well
respected in Gotham.

Thomas was born into the wealthy, and well-respected, Wayne family. His father,
Patrick, was the CEO of Wayne Enterprises. Thomas always wanted to help people,
and so he became a surgeon, and saved the lives of many people. When his father
passed away, Thomas inherited the family business, and the family home, the
stately Wayne Manor.

Martha Wayne (n√©e Kane) was the daughter of Roderick Kane, the president of Kane
chemicals. They met in college, fell in love, and married.

They were wealthy, had a beautiful home, and were liked by all. But with all the
love they had for each other, they wanted to share it. They tried many times to
conceive a child, they remained childless. No one but their very closest friends
knew of the sorrow it brought them to never be able to bring a child into the
world.

But finally it happened. Martha conceived.
